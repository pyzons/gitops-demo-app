# Container Insights Implementation Summary

## ✅ **CURRENT STATUS: WORKING**

Container Insights has been successfully implemented and is now collecting data from your e-commerce microservices.

## 🔧 **Issues Found and Fixed**

### ❌ **Original Problems**
1. **IAM Permission Failures**: CloudWatch Agent and Fluent Bit were using node instance roles without proper permissions
2. **Access Denied Errors**: Continuous `AccessDeniedException` errors preventing data collection
3. **No Metrics Collection**: Dashboard would never populate due to permission issues
4. **Misleading Timeline**: Claimed 5-10 minutes when metrics would never appear

### ✅ **Solutions Implemented**
1. **Created Proper IAM Service Accounts**: Both CloudWatch Agent and Fluent Bit now have dedicated service accounts with correct IAM roles
2. **Custom IAM Policy**: Created comprehensive policy with all required permissions for logs and metrics
3. **Fixed Service Account Assignment**: Ensured both agents use their respective service accounts
4. **Corrected Timeline**: Metrics now appear in 2-3 minutes after proper setup

## 📊 **What's Working Now**

### Infrastructure
- ✅ **CloudWatch Agent**: 2/2 pods running, collecting metrics
- ✅ **Fluent Bit**: 2/2 pods running, collecting logs  
- ✅ **Log Groups**: All 3 log groups created and receiving data
- ✅ **IAM Permissions**: All permission issues resolved
- ✅ **Custom Dashboard**: Created and accessible
